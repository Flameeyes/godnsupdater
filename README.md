# godnsupdater

A set of dynamic DNS updaters in Go.

## Background

I started this as a way to updater my afraid.org FreeDNS entry, since they
support AAAA (IPv6) records. Since I then wanted to support other providers
(such as Gandi) I started factoring out common functions into a library and a
set of tools.
